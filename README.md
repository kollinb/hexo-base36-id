# hexo-base36-id
Add this to your scripts folder. When you generate your posts, a base-36-id will be appended to it. This id can be used inside your config fileâ€”for example, I have my permalink format setup as :year/:month/:day/:id. The number of articles you have is cached inside the article_cache.json file for future generations. If you delete this file it may cause issues with your posts.
